<h1>Hire a Hottub Version 2</h1>

<a href="https://hireahottub2.netlify.com/" target="_blank"><img src="img/ht2.png"/></a>

<p> Second iteration of this site Improving on design aspects and learning new skills. </p>
<ul>
<p>Skills used</p>
  <li>CSS Grid boxes</li>
  <li>Mobile Development</li>
  <li>Hero Images</li>
  <li>Footer Design</li>
  <li>Css picture galleries</li>
</ul>

<p>I felt that this was a specific improvement on my first effort, and i was able to learn new skills during the development of this site.</p>
<p> I found it challenging to make additions to the site and keep the context formatted</p>
<p>Learning mobile development and media views were the key points i took away from this build</p>
